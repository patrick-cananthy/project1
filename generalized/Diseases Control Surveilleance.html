                        <p>The disease control and surveillance services play a crucial role in monitoring, preventing, and managing infectious diseases within the community. These services typically involve systematic monitoring of disease trends, identification
                            of outbreaks, and implementation of measures to control the spread of diseases. The hospital conducts regular surveillance activities to detect and report communicable diseases promptly, collaborating with public health authorities
                            to implement preventive measures such as vaccination campaigns and health education initiatives. They also provide training and resources to healthcare providers and the community to enhance awareness and preparedness for disease
                            outbreaks. Overall, Tema General Hospital's disease control and surveillance services focus on safeguarding public health through proactive monitoring, rapid response to outbreaks, and community engagement to promote health
                            and prevent the spread of infectious diseases.</p>
