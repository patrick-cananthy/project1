                        <h2>Diabetic</h2>
                        <p>Our diabetic services are designed to provide comprehensive care and support for individuals living with diabetes mellitus. Patients benefit from thorough diagnosis and ongoing monitoring of blood glucose levels to ensure effective
                            management of their condition. Treatment plans are tailored to each patient's needs and may include lifestyle adjustments, medication management (including oral medications and insulin therapy), and regular medical check-ups
                            to assess progress and adjust treatment as necessary. The hospital's team of healthcare professionals, including diabetes educators and nutritionists, offer personalized education on self-care practices, such as blood glucose
                            monitoring and healthy eating habits. The focus is on preventing complications associated with diabetes through proactive management, regular screenings, and patient empowerment. Tema General Hospital's diabetic services aim
                            to enhance the quality of life for patients by promoting optimal health outcomes and empowering them to take control of their diabetes management journey.</p>
