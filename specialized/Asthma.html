                        <h2>Asthma Clinic</h2>
                        <p>The asthma clinic at Tema General Hospital offers specialized care for patients managing asthma, a chronic respiratory condition. Led by experienced pulmonologists and respiratory therapists, the clinic provides comprehensive services
                            including diagnosis, treatment planning, and ongoing management. Patients undergo thorough assessments to determine asthma severity using advanced lung function tests like spirometry. Individualized asthma action plans are
                            developed, incorporating medications such as inhalers and oral treatments tailored to each patient's needs. Education forms a critical part of the clinic's approach, ensuring patients understand asthma triggers, symptoms, and
                            effective self-management techniques like proper inhaler use and recognizing exacerbations. Regular follow-up appointments enable continuous monitoring of asthma control, with adjustments made to treatment plans as necessary.
                            The clinic's commitment to patient care extends to offering allergy testing when indicated and facilitating referrals to other healthcare specialties within the hospital as required, aiming to enhance patients' overall well-being
                            and quality of life.</p>
