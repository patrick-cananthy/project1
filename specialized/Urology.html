                        <p>The urology clinic specializes in diagnosing and treating disorders related to the urinary tract and male reproductive system. Staffed by urologists who are experts in their field, the clinic offers a range of services including
                            consultations, diagnostic tests (such as ultrasound and urodynamic studies), and treatments for conditions like kidney stones, urinary tract infections, prostate issues, and male infertility. The clinic provides personalized
                            care plans tailored to each patient's needs, which may include medical management, minimally invasive procedures, or surgery when necessary. Education about urological health and preventive measures is also a key focus, helping
                            patients understand their conditions and make informed decisions about their care. The urology clinic at Tema General Hospital aims to improve patients' quality of life through effective treatment, compassionate care, and ongoing
                            support..
