                Our Beginnings
            </h2>
            <p>
                Tema General Hospital, established in 1954, was originally built to serve workers involved in the construction of the Tema Harbour. After fulfilling this initial purpose, the hospital was handed over to the Government of Ghana in 1962 for public use,
                marking the start of its broader role in healthcare delivery within the Tema Metropolitan Area. Strategically located with access to a robust road network and situated in a key commercial hub, the hospital has grown into one of the busiest
                healthcare facilities in the country. Over the years, Tema General Hospital has become a major referral point for other clinics and hospitals within the metropolis, particularly catering to road traffic and industrial accident victims,
                including those from the nearby motorway. <br /> The hospital serves an extensive catchment area that covers the entire Tema Metropolis and its surrounding towns and villages, including Sakumono, Lashibi, Nungua, and even
                the Dangme West and Dangme East districts. This wide reach ensures that Tema General Hospital plays a vital role in addressing the healthcare needs of the region’s diverse and populous communities. <br />
            </p>
            <p>With the introduction of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), hospital attendance surged dramatically, with outpatient visits increasing from 180,914 in 2007 to 207,329 in 2008. However, the hospital’s ability to handle the increased
                demand has been strained by several challenges. These include insufficient staffing, inadequate accommodation for employees, poor infrastructure with structural defects, and a lack of security personnel. Additionally, the hospital’s mortuary
                was shut down due to its deteriorated condition, and the absence of a pathologist has complicated autopsy procedures. Financially, NHIS reimbursement delays and the use of district-level tariffs for claims further strain the hospital’s
                resources. <br> Despite these challenges, Tema General Hospital continues to evolve to meet the healthcare demands of its patients. It currently operates with twelve wards, a bed capacity of 439, and provides 24-hour specialist and general
                services to both outpatients and inpatients. The hospital offers a wide range of services, including Internal Medicine, General Surgery, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Paediatrics, Reproductive and Child Health Care/Family Planning, and Emergency
                Services. Additionally, it runs specialized clinics such as Eye Care, Dental, Diabetic Clinic, Intensive Care, Dermatology, ENT, Chest, Hypertensive, and Anesthetic Clinics, as well as the ART/PMTCT Unit. <br> Support services such as
                Laboratory/Blood Bank, Radiology/Ultrasound, Pharmacy, Physiotherapy, and ECG, along with facilities including a Staff Rest Room, Catering, Mortuary, Laundry/CSSD, Stores and Supplies, Estate, Social Welfare, Mental Health Unit, and Wellness
                Centre, ensure comprehensive care delivery.</p>
